# About
I completed my PhD at [Informatics Institute](http://ivi.uva.nl/) / [Information and Language Processing Systems](http://ilps.science.uva.nl/), University of Amsterdam.
I worked on Statistical Machine Translation, advised by [Christof Monz](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/c.monz/) and [Arianna Bisazza](http://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~bisazzaa/).

I am interested in natural language processing, deep learning, and [probabilistic programing](http://probabilistic-programming.org).

Before starting my PhD, I completed my master, [EMLCT](http://lct-master.org/), in computational linguistics at University of Groningen and Charles University in Prague. [Marco Wiering](http://www.ai.rug.nl/~mwiering/) and [Daniel Zeman](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/daniel-zeman) were my master thesis supervisors.
