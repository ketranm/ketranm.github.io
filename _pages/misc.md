I am addicted to traveling solo. Kyrgyzstan is my favorite destination, by far.

I don't often browse the Internet, but when I do, I [quora](http://www.quora.com/Ke-Tran) or [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent).

I like [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/ketran). I'm into sci-fi, non-fiction and [poetry](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/quotes?item=qt2743153).

I speak a little [Sindarin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin).
