# About
I am interested in natural language processing, deep learning, and probabilistic programing.

I did my PhD at [Information and Language Processing Systems](http://ilps.science.uva.nl/) / [Informatics Institute](http://ivi.uva.nl/), University of Amsterdam. During my PhD, I worked on machine translation and deep learning, advised by [Christof Monz](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/c.monz/) and [Arianna Bisazza](http://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~bisazzaa/). My PhD thesis can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdfs/thesis.pdf).

Before starting my PhD, I completed my master, [EMLCT](http://lct-master.org/), in computational linguistics at University of Groningen and Charles University in Prague. [Marco Wiering](http://www.ai.rug.nl/~mwiering/) and [Daniel Zeman](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/daniel-zeman) were my master thesis supervisors.
